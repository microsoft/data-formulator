Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should first refine users' goal and then create a python function in the output section based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL]:\n\n    1. First, refine users' [GOAL]. The main objective in this step is to check if \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" provided by the user are sufficient to achieve their \"goal\". Concretely:\n        - based on the user's \"goal\" and \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\", elaborate the goal into a \"detailed_instruction\".\n        - \"display_instruction\" is a short verb phrase describing the users' goal. \n            - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n            - generate it based on detailed_instruction and the suggested chart_type and chart_encodings, but don't need to mention the chart details.\n            - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n            - if the user specification follows up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n            - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n            - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n                * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n                * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n        - determine \"output_fields\", the desired fields that the output data should have to achieve the user's goal, it's a good idea to include intermediate fields here.\n        - then decide \"chart_encodings\", which maps visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized, \n            - the \"chart_encodings\" should be created to support the user's \"chart_type\".\n            - first, determine whether the user has provided sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\" that are needed to achieve their goal:\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" are sufficient, simply copy it.\n                - if the user didn't provide sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\", add missing fields in \"chart_encodings\" (ordered them based on whether the field will be used in x,y axes or legends);\n                    - \"chart_encodings\" should only include fields that will be visualized (do not include other intermediate fields from \"output_fields\")  \n                    - when adding new fields to \"chart_encodings\", be efficient and add only a minimal number of fields that are needed to achive the user's goal. \n                    - generally, the total number of fields in \"chart_encodings\" should be no more than 3 for x,y,legend.\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" is sufficient but can be optimized, you can reorder encodings to visualize the data more effectively.\n            - sometimes, user may provide instruction to update visualizations fields they provided. You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- try to use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 380270577.0, 402111870.0, 533345358.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0, 2767891499.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: 33619971.0, 140689412.0, nan, ..., nan, nan, 46260220.0, nan\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 23000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 237477.0, 417703.0, 519541.0, nan\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\n{\n    \"instruction\": \"show top 30 movies based on their profit\",\n    \"chart_type\": \"Scatter Plot\",\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"Production Budget\",\n        \"y\": \"Worldwide Gross\",\n        \"color\": \"Title\"\n    }\n}","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"Calculate the profit for each movie (Worldwide Gross minus Production Budget), then select the top 30 movies with the highest profit.

Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    - second section is the concepts explanation that should be a json block (start with ```json) in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n\n[CODE EXPLANATION]\n\n...(explanation of the code)\n\n[CONCEPTS EXPLANATION]\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"field\": \"...\",\n        \"explanation\": \"...\"\n    }\n]\n\n```\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 441226247.0, 533345358.0, 600788188.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 1065659812.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0, 2767891499.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: 2638319.0, 3907625.0, 4653193.0, ..., 124058348.0, 153389976.0, 234119058.0, 320830925.0\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 23000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: 46.0, 72.0, 74.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 261439.0, 292562.0, 417703.0, 519541.0\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[CODE]\n\nhere is the transformation code: \nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_data(df_movies):\n    # Calculate profit for each movie\n    df_movies['Profit'] = df_movies['Worldwide Gross'] -

what data would be needed, and your job is to create a python function based on the input data summary, transformation instruction and expected fields.\nThe users' instruction includes \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" that describe the visualization they want, and natural language instructions \"goal\" that describe what data is needed.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should first refine users' goal and then create a python function in the output section based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL]:\n\n    1. First, refine users' [GOAL]. The main objective in this step is to check if \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" provided by the user are sufficient to achieve their \"goal\". Concretely:\n        - based on the user's \"goal\" and \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\", elaborate the goal into a \"detailed_instruction\".\n        - \"display_instruction\" is a short verb phrase describing the users' goal. \n            - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n            - generate it based on detailed_instruction and the suggested chart_type and chart_encodings, but don't need to mention the chart details.\n            - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n            - if the user specification follows up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n            - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n            - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n                * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n                * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n        - determine \"output_fields\", the desired fields that the output data should have to achieve the user's goal, it's a good idea to include intermediate fields here.\n        - then decide \"chart_encodings\", which maps visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized, \n            - the \"chart_encodings\" should be created to support the user's \"chart_type\".\n            - first, determine whether the user has provided sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\" that are needed to achieve their goal:\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" are sufficient, simply copy it.\n                - if the user didn't provide sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\", add missing fields in \"chart_encodings\" (ordered them based on whether the field will be used in x,y axes or legends);\n                    - \"chart_encodings\" should only include fields that will be visualized (do not include other intermediate fields from \"output_fields\")  \n                    - when adding new fields to \"chart_encodings\", be efficient and add only a minimal number of fields that are needed to achive the user's goal. \n                    - generally, the total number of fields in \"chart_encodings\" should be no more than 3 for x,y,legend.\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" is sufficient but can be optimized, you can reorder encodings to visualize the data more effectively.\n            - sometimes, user may provide instruction to update visualizations fields they provided. You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- try to use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 380270577.0, 402111870.0, 533345358.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0, 2767891499.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: 33619971.0, 140689412.0, nan, ..., nan, nan, 46260220.0, nan\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 23000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 237477.0, 417703.0, 519541.0, nan\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\n{\n    \"instruction\": \"show top 30 movies based on their profit\",\n    \"chart_type\": \"Scatter Plot\",\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"Production Budget\",\n        \"y\": \"Worldwide Gross\",\n        \"color\": \"Title\"\n    }\n}","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"Calculate the profit for each movie (Worldwide Gross minus Production Budget), then select the top 30 movies with the highest profit.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    -

Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\". \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- you can use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 441226247.0, 533345358.0, 600788188.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 976457891.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: nan, 1978111.0, 140689412.0, ..., 100178981.0, 104578578.0, 234119058.0, 320830925.0\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 15000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 245271.0, 261439.0, 326950.0, 417703.0\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nshow top 20 directories based on profit breakdown by their movies","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"Show top 20 directors based on total profit, with a breakdown of profit by their individual movies\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Show top 20 **directors** by total **profit** with movie breakdown\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"Calculate profit (Worldwide Gross - Production Budget) for each movie, then aggregate by director to find top 20 directors by total profit.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    -

Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should first refine users' goal and then create a python function in the output section based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL]:\n\n    1. First, refine users' [GOAL]. The main objective in this step is to check if \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" provided by the user are sufficient to achieve their \"goal\". Concretely:\n        - based on the user's \"goal\" and \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\", elaborate the goal into a \"detailed_instruction\".\n        - \"display_instruction\" is a short verb phrase describing the users' goal. \n            - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n            - generate it based on detailed_instruction and the suggested chart_type and chart_encodings, but don't need to mention the chart details.\n            - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n            - if the user specification follows up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n            - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n            - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n                * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n                * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n        - determine \"output_fields\", the desired fields that the output data should have to achieve the user's goal, it's a good idea to include intermediate fields here.\n        - then decide \"chart_encodings\", which maps visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized, \n            - the \"chart_encodings\" should be created to support the user's \"chart_type\".\n            - first, determine whether the user has provided sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\" that are needed to achieve their goal:\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" are sufficient, simply copy it.\n                - if the user didn't provide sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\", add missing fields in \"chart_encodings\" (ordered them based on whether the field will be used in x,y axes or legends);\n                    - \"chart_encodings\" should only include fields that will be visualized (do not include other intermediate fields from \"output_fields\")  \n                    - when adding new fields to \"chart_encodings\", be efficient and add only a minimal number of fields that are needed to achive the user's goal. \n                    - generally, the total number of fields in \"chart_encodings\" should be no more than 3 for x,y,legend.\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" is sufficient but can be optimized, you can reorder encodings to visualize the data more effectively.\n            - sometimes, user may provide instruction to update visualizations fields they provided. You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- try to use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 441226247.0, 533345358.0, 600788188.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 976457891.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: nan, 1978111.0, 140689412.0, ..., 100178981.0, 104578578.0, 234119058.0, 320830925.0\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 15000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 245271.0, 261439.0, 326950.0, 417703.0\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nshow top 20 directories based on profit breakdown by their movies","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"Show top 20 directors based on total profit, with a breakdown of profit by their individual movies\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Show top 20 **directors** by total **profit** with movie breakdown\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"Calculate profit (Worldwide Gross - Production Budget) for each movie, then aggregate by director to find top 20 directors by total profit.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    -

about what visualization they would like to create, and your job is to recommend a transformed data that can be used to create the visualization and write a python function to transform the data.\nThe recommendation and transformation function should be based on the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] provided by the user. \nThe [CONTEXT] shows what the current dataset is, and the [GOAL] describes what the user wants the data for.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\". \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- you can use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 403706375.0, 441226247.0, 533345358.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 976457891.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: 15442818.0, 17031573.0, 33619971.0, ..., nan, nan, 46260220.0, nan\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 5000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 212985.0, 237477.0, 417703.0, nan\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nDo higher production budgets correlate with better ratings?","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"The user wants to analyze the correlation between production budgets and movie ratings to understand if higher budgets lead to better ratings.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Show correlation between **Production Budget** and **ratings**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"Create a scatter plot visualization to show the relationship between Production Budget and ratings.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    - second section is the concepts explanation that should be a json block (start with ```json) in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n\n[CODE EXPLANATION]\n\n...(explanation of the code)\n\n[CONCEPTS EXPLANATION]\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"field\": \"...\",\n        \"explanation\": \"...\"\n

will provide you information about what data would be needed, and your job is to create a python function based on the input data summary, transformation instruction and expected fields.\nThe users' instruction includes \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" that describe the visualization they want, and natural language instructions \"goal\" that describe what data is needed.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should first refine users' goal and then create a python function in the output section based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL]:\n\n    1. First, refine users' [GOAL]. The main objective in this step is to check if \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" provided by the user are sufficient to achieve their \"goal\". Concretely:\n        - based on the user's \"goal\" and \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\", elaborate the goal into a \"detailed_instruction\".\n        - \"display_instruction\" is a short verb phrase describing the users' goal. \n            - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n            - generate it based on detailed_instruction and the suggested chart_type and chart_encodings, but don't need to mention the chart details.\n            - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n            - if the user specification follows up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n            - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n            - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n                * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n                * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n        - determine \"output_fields\", the desired fields that the output data should have to achieve the user's goal, it's a good idea to include intermediate fields here.\n        - then decide \"chart_encodings\", which maps visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized, \n            - the \"chart_encodings\" should be created to support the user's \"chart_type\".\n            - first, determine whether the user has provided sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\" that are needed to achieve their goal:\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" are sufficient, simply copy it.\n                - if the user didn't provide sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\", add missing fields in \"chart_encodings\" (ordered them based on whether the field will be used in x,y axes or legends);\n                    - \"chart_encodings\" should only include fields that will be visualized (do not include other intermediate fields from \"output_fields\")  \n                    - when adding new fields to \"chart_encodings\", be efficient and add only a minimal number of fields that are needed to achive the user's goal. \n                    - generally, the total number of fields in \"chart_encodings\" should be no more than 3 for x,y,legend.\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" is sufficient but can be optimized, you can reorder encodings to visualize the data more effectively.\n            - sometimes, user may provide instruction to update visualizations fields they provided. You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- try to use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 403706375.0, 441226247.0, 533345358.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 976457891.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: 15442818.0, 17031573.0, 33619971.0, ..., nan, nan, 46260220.0, nan\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 5000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 212985.0, 237477.0, 417703.0, nan\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nDo higher production budgets correlate with better ratings?","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"The user wants to analyze the correlation between production budgets and movie ratings to understand if higher budgets lead to better ratings.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Show correlation between **Production Budget** and **ratings**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"Create a scatter plot visualization to show the relationship between Production Budget and ratings.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    - second section is the concepts explanation that should be a json block (start with ```json) in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n\n[CODE EXPLANATION]\n\n...(explanation of the code)\n\n[CONCEPTS EXPLANATION]\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"field\": \"...\",\n        \"explanation\": \"...\"\n

You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- try to use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (movies)\n\n## fields\n\t*Title -- type: object, values: Silent Movie, 9, Rapa Nui, ..., A Night at the Roxbury, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gridiron Gang, Journey from the Fall\n\t*US Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 403706375.0, 441226247.0, 533345358.0, 760167650.0\n\t*Worldwide Gross -- type: float64, values: 0.0, 401.0, 423.0, ..., 937499905.0, 976457891.0, 1133027325.0, 1842879955.0\n\t*US DVD Sales -- type: float64, values: 15442818.0, 17031573.0, 33619971.0, ..., nan, nan, 46260220.0, nan\n\t*Production Budget -- type: float64, values: 218.0, 1100.0, 5000.0, ..., 237000000.0, 250000000.0, 258000000.0, 300000000.0\n\t*Release Date -- type: object, values: Apr 01 1965, Apr 01 1975, Apr 01 1986, ..., Sep 30 1983, Sep 30 1994, Sep 30 2005, Sep 30 2006\n\t*MPAA Rating -- type: object, values: G, NC-17, Not Rated, Open, PG, PG-13, R\n\t*Running Time min -- type: float64, values: nan, nan, nan, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*Distributor -- type: object, values: 20th Century Fox, 3D Entertainment, 8X Entertainment, ..., Women Make Movies, Yari Film Group Releasing, Yash Raj Films, Zeitgeist\n\t*Source -- type: object, values: Based on Book/Short Story, Based on Comic/Graphic Novel, Based on Factual Book/Article, ..., Original Screenplay, Remake, Spin-Off, Traditional/Legend/Fairytale\n\t*Major Genre -- type: object, values: Action, Adventure, Black Comedy, ..., Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, Western\n\t*Creative Type -- type: object, values: Contemporary Fiction, Dramatization, Factual, ..., Kids Fiction, Multiple Creative Types, Science Fiction, Super Hero\n\t*Director -- type: object, values: Abel Ferrara, Adam McKay, Adam Shankman, ..., Yimou Zhang, Zach Braff, Zack Snyder, Zak Penn\n\t*Rotten Tomatoes Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Rating -- type: float64, values: 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, ..., nan, nan, nan, nan\n\t*IMDB Votes -- type: float64, values: 18.0, 25.0, 26.0, ..., 212985.0, 237477.0, 417703.0, nan\n\n## sample\n                        Title  US Gross  Worldwide Gross US DVD Sales  Production Budget Release Date MPAA Rating Running Time min Distributor               Source Major Genre         Creative Type Director  Rotten Tomatoes Rating  IMDB Rating  IMDB Votes\n0              The Land Girls    146083           146083         None            8000000  Jun 12 1998           R             None    Gramercy                 None        None                  None     None                     NaN          6.1      1071.0\n1      First Love, Last Rites     10876            10876         None             300000  Aug 07 1998           R             None      Strand                 None       Drama                  None     None                     NaN          6.9       207.0\n2  I Married a Strange Person    203134           203134         None             250000  Aug 28 1998        None             None   Lionsgate                 None      Comedy                  None     None                     NaN          6.8       865.0\n3        Let's Talk About Sex    373615           373615         None             300000  Sep 11 1998        None             None   Fine Line                 None      Comedy                  None     None                    13.0          NaN         NaN\n4                        Slam   1009819          1087521         None            1000000  Oct 09 1998           R             None     Trimark  Original Screenplay       Drama  Contemporary Fiction     None                    62.0          3.4       165.0\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nDo higher production budgets correlate with better ratings?","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"The user wants to analyze the correlation between production budgets and movie ratings to understand if higher budgets lead to better ratings.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Show correlation between **Production Budget** and **ratings**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"Create a scatter plot visualization to show the relationship between Production Budget and ratings.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4. If the code is about statistical analysis, you should explain the statistical analysis in the explanation as a concept named \"Statistical Analysis\" in the [CONCEPTS EXPLANATION] section.\n    - explain how you model the data, which fields are used, how data processing is done, and what models are used.\n    - suggest some other modeling approaches that can be used to analyze the data in the explanation as well.\n    \nThe focus is to explain how new fields are computed, don't generate explanation for low-level actions like \"return\", \"load data\" etc. \n\nProvide the result in the following two sections:\n    - first section is the code explanation that should be a markdown block explaining the code, in the [CODE EXPLANATION] section.\n        - remember to highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs in the code explanation.\n    -

Bigger Budgets Win with Great Reviews\n\nLow-budget films struggle regardless of reviews, averaging just $1.3M profit even with poor ratings. The real story emerges with blockbusters: films budgeted over $100M earn an average of $516M profit when they achieve 81-100% on Rotten Tomatoes—a staggering return that dwarfs all other categories.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760744573683)]\n\nMid-budget films ($10M-$50M) show steady but modest profits across all rating tiers, rarely exceeding $30M in average returns. The data reveals a clear pattern: critical acclaim matters most when paired with substantial production investment.\n\n**In summary**, the film industry's most profitable strategy combines massive budgets with quality execution—blockbusters that earn top critic scores generate extraordinary returns, while smaller productions face profit ceilings regardless of critical reception.","style":"short note","selectedChartIds":["chart-1760744573683"],"createdAt":1760831325401},{"id":"report-1760831241705-9562","content":"# Top Directors Dominate with Action & Adventure Films\n\nSteven Spielberg leads all directors with over $7 billion in total profit, driven primarily by action ($2.3B) and drama ($2.2B) films. James Cameron follows at $5.1B, focusing almost exclusively on action blockbusters.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760743804092)]\n\nAdventure films emerge as the most profitable genre across multiple directors—Chris Columbus, George Lucas, and Peter Jackson each generated $3B+ primarily from adventure franchises. Meanwhile, directors like Michael Bay and Gore Verbinski found success mixing action with adventure content.\n\n**In summary**, the most profitable directors concentrate on action and adventure genres, with Spielberg's genre diversity being the exception among top earners.

The data tells a fascinating story about Hollywood's biggest gambles.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760742454293)]\n\nLooking at the relationship between production budgets and worldwide gross, there's a clear trend: **bigger budgets *can* lead to bigger returns**, but it's far from guaranteed. The sweet spot appears to be around $200-250M, where blockbusters like *Avatar* ($2.77B worldwide) dominate. However, the chart reveals something crucial—**most films cluster in the lower-left corner**, suggesting that moderate budgets between $25-100M are the industry standard, though they rarely break the billion-dollar barrier.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760743347871)]\n\nWhen we examine the **top performers by genre**, the winners become crystal clear. *Avatar* leads the pack with an astounding $2.53B profit, followed by adventure franchises like *Jurassic Park* and *The Lord of the Rings*. Action and adventure films dominate profitability, while genres like comedy, horror, and romantic comedies show more modest—but still impressive—returns in the $300-450M range. Musicals like *The Sound of Music* prove timeless appeal still pays dividends.\n\n**In summary**, while throwing money at a film doesn't guarantee success, the blockbuster strategy works when executed well—particularly for action and adventure franchises.
