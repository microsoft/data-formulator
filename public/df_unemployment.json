help user to recommend data that will be used for visualization.\nThe user will provide you information about what visualization they would like to create, and your job is to recommend a transformed data that can be used to create the visualization and write a python function to transform the data.\nThe recommendation and transformation function should be based on the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] provided by the user. \nThe [CONTEXT] shows what the current dataset is, and the [GOAL] describes what the user wants the data for.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\". \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- you can use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (unemployment_across_industries)\n\n## fields\n\t*series -- type: object, values: Agriculture, Business services, Construction, ..., Other, Self-employed, Transportation and Utilities, Wholesale and Retail Trade\n\t*year -- type: int64, values: 2000, 2001, 2002, ..., 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\t*month -- type: int64, values: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11, 12\n\t*count -- type: int64, values: 2, 8, 9, ..., 2071, 2154, 2194, 2440\n\t*rate -- type: float64, values: 0.3, 1.3, 1.5, ..., 21.4, 22.7, 24.7, 27.1\n\t*date -- type: object, values: 2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z, ..., 2009-11-01T07:00:00.000Z, 2009-12-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n\n## sample\n       series  year  month  count  rate                      date\n0  Government  2000      1    430   2.1  2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z\n1  Government  2000      2    409   2.0  2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n2  Government  2000      3    311   1.5  2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z\n3  Government  2000      4    269   1.3  2000-04-01T08:00:00.000Z\n4  Government  2000      5    370   1.9  2000-05-01T07:00:00.000Z\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nCompare **unemployment trends** across all industries from 2000-2010"},{"role":"assistant","content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"User wants to compare unemployment trends across all industries from 2000-2010 to understand how different sectors were affected over time.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Compare **unemployment rates** across **industries** over time\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on x-axis and unemployment rate on y-axis, with different colored lines for each industry series, will effectively show the trends and allow comparison of how unemployment evolved across different sectors during this period.\",\n    \"output_fields\": [\"date\", \"series\", \"rate\"],\n    \"chart_type\": \"line\",\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"date\",\n        \"y\": \"rate\",\n        \"color\": \"series\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_data(df_unemployment):\n    # Convert date string to datetime and then to string format for visualization\n    df_unemployment['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_unemployment['date']).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    \n    # Select only the necessary columns for visualization\n    transformed_df = df_unemployment[['date', 'series', 'rate']].copy()\n    \n    return transformed_df\n```"}],"trigger":{"tableId":"unemployment-across-industries","sourceTableIds":["unemployment-across-industries"],"instruction":"Compare **unemployment trends** across all industries from 2000-2010","displayInstruction":"Compare **unemployment rates** across **industries** over time","chart":{"id":"chart-1760745546913","chartType":"Auto","encodingMap":{},"tableRef":"unemployment-across-industries","saved":false,"source":"trigger","unread":true},"resultTableId":"table-544555"},"explanation":{"agent":"CodeExplanationAgent","code":"- Convert the **date** field from timestamp format to a standardized string format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for cleaner visualization\n- Select and retain only three key fields: **date**, **series** (industry name), and **rate** (unemployment rate percentage)\n- Return a simplified dataset focused on tracking unemployment rates across different industries over time","concepts":[],"dialog":[{"content":"You are a data scientist to help user explain code, \nso that a non-code can clearly understand what the code is doing, you are provided with a summary of the input data, and the transformation code.\n\nYour goal:\n1.

The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation.

that will be used for visualization.\nThe user will provide you information about what visualization they would like to create, and your job is to recommend a transformed data that can be used to create the visualization and write a python function to transform the data.\nThe recommendation and transformation function should be based on the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] provided by the user. \nThe [CONTEXT] shows what the current dataset is, and the [GOAL] describes what the user wants the data for.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\". \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- you can use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (unemployment_across_industries)\n\n## fields\n\t*series -- type: object, values: Agriculture, Business services, Construction, ..., Other, Self-employed, Transportation and Utilities, Wholesale and Retail Trade\n\t*year -- type: int64, values: 2000, 2001, 2002, ..., 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\t*month -- type: int64, values: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11, 12\n\t*count -- type: int64, values: 2, 8, 9, ..., 2071, 2154, 2194, 2440\n\t*rate -- type: float64, values: 0.3, 1.3, 1.5, ..., 21.4, 22.7, 24.7, 27.1\n\t*date -- type: object, values: 2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z, ..., 2009-11-01T07:00:00.000Z, 2009-12-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n\n## sample\n       series  year  month  count  rate                      date\n0  Government  2000      1    430   2.1  2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z\n1  Government  2000      2    409   2.0  2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n2  Government  2000      3    311   1.5  2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z\n3  Government  2000      4    269   1.3  2000-04-01T08:00:00.000Z\n4  Government  2000      5    370   1.9  2000-05-01T07:00:00.000Z\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nHow does **seasonal variation** in unemployment differ across **industries**?","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"Analyze how seasonal variation in unemployment differs across industries by examining the cyclical patterns in unemployment rates throughout the year for different industry sectors.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Compare seasonal unemployment patterns across **industries**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"To visualize seasonal variation across industries, we should calculate average unemployment rates by month for each industry series.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4.

Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            -

note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- you can use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (unemployment_across_industries)\n\n## fields\n\t*series -- type: object, values: Agriculture, Business services, Construction, ..., Other, Self-employed, Transportation and Utilities, Wholesale and Retail Trade\n\t*year -- type: int64, values: 2000, 2001, 2002, ..., 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\t*month -- type: int64, values: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11, 12\n\t*count -- type: int64, values: 2, 8, 9, ..., 2071, 2154, 2194, 2440\n\t*rate -- type: float64, values: 0.3, 1.3, 1.5, ..., 21.4, 22.7, 24.7, 27.1\n\t*date -- type: object, values: 2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z, ..., 2009-11-01T07:00:00.000Z, 2009-12-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n\n## sample\n       series  year  month  count  rate                      date\n0  Government  2000      1    430   2.1  2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z\n1  Government  2000      2    409   2.0  2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n2  Government  2000      3    311   1.5  2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z\n3  Government  2000      4    269   1.3  2000-04-01T08:00:00.000Z\n4  Government  2000      5    370   1.9  2000-05-01T07:00:00.000Z\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nCompare **unemployment trends** across all industries from 2000-2010"},{"role":"assistant","content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"User wants to compare unemployment trends across all industries from 2000-2010 to understand how different sectors were affected over time.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Compare **unemployment rates** across **industries** over time\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on x-axis and unemployment rate on y-axis, with different colored lines for each industry series, will effectively show the trends and allow comparison of how unemployment evolved across different sectors during this period.\",\n    \"output_fields\": [\"date\", \"series\", \"rate\"],\n    \"chart_type\": \"line\",\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"date\",\n        \"y\": \"rate\",\n        \"color\": \"series\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_data(df_unemployment):\n    # Convert date string to datetime and then to string format for visualization\n    df_unemployment['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_unemployment['date']).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    \n    # Select only the necessary columns for visualization\n    transformed_df = df_unemployment[['date', 'series', 'rate']].copy()\n    \n    return transformed_df\n```"},{"role":"user","content":"This is the result from the latest python code:\n\n         date      series  rate\n0  2000-01-01  Government   2.1\n1  2000-02-01  Government   2.0\n2  2000-03-01  Government   1.5\n3  2000-04-01  Government   1.3\n4  2000-05-01  Government   1.9\n5  2000-06-01  Government   3.1\n6  2000-07-01  Government   2.9\n7  2000-08-01  Government   3.1\n8  2000-09-01  Government   2.1\n9  2000-10-01  Government   2.0\n......\n\nUpdate the code above based on the following instruction:\n\nWhich industries showed the **sharpest increases** in unemployment during **2008-2009**?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"User wants to identify which industries experienced the sharpest increases in unemployment rates during the 2008-2009 financial crisis period by calculating the change in unemployment rate for each industry.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Identify industries with **sharpest unemployment rate increases** during **2008-2009**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"A bar chart showing the change in unemployment rate from 2008 to 2009 for each industry will clearly visualize which sectors were hit hardest during the financial crisis.

You should generate a good itemized explanation of the code so that the reader can understand high-level steps of what the data transformation is doing.\n    - Be very concise, and stay at a high-level. The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation. Format mathematical expressions using:\n        - Inline math: `\\( ... \\)` for formulas within text\n        - Block math: `\\[ ... \\]` for standalone formulas\n        - Examples: `\\( \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Cost}} \\)` for ratios, `\\[ \\text{Score} = \\text{Rating} \\times \\text{Worldwide\\_Gross} \\]` for formulas\n        - note: when using underscores as part of the text, you need to escape them with a backslash, e.g., `\\_`\n    - Note: don't use math notation for fields whose computation is trivial (use plain english), it will likely be confusing to the reader. \n      Only use math notation for fields that can not be easilyexplained in plain english. Use it sparingly.\n3. If there are multiple fields that have the similar computation, you can explain them together in one explanation.\n    - in \"field\", you can provide a list of fields in format of \"field1, field2, ...\"\n    - in \"explanation\", you can provide a single explanation for the computation of the fields.\n    - for example, if you have fields like \"Norm_Rating\", \"Norm_Gross\", \"Critical_Commercial_Score\", you can explain Norm_Rating, Norm_Gross together in one explanation and explain Critical_Commercial_Score in another explanation.\n4.

data scientist to help user to recommend data that will be used for visualization.\nThe user will provide you information about what visualization they would like to create, and your job is to recommend a transformed data that can be used to create the visualization and write a python function to transform the data.\nThe recommendation and transformation function should be based on the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] provided by the user. \nThe [CONTEXT] shows what the current dataset is, and the [GOAL] describes what the user wants the data for.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should infer the appropriate data and create in the output section a python function based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL] in two steps:\n\n1. First, based on users' [GOAL]. Create a json object that represents the inferred user intent. The json object should have the following format:\n\n{\n    \"mode\": \"\" // string, one of \"infer\", \"overview\", \"distribution\", \"summary\", \"forecast\"\n    \"recap\": \"...\" // string, a short summary of the user's goal.\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the even shorter verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"recommendation\": \"...\" // string, explain why this recommendation is made\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have (i.e., the goal of transformed data), it's a good idea to preseve intermediate fields here\n    \"chart_type\": \"\" // string, one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\". \"chart_type\" should either be inferred from user instruction, or recommend if the user didn't specify any.\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of output fields, appropriate visual channels for different chart types are defined below.\n}\n\nConcretely:\n    - recap what the user's goal is in a short summary in \"recap\".\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is clear already, simply infer what the user mean. Set \"mode\" as \"infer\" and create \"output_fields\" and \"chart_encodings\" based off user description.\n    - If the user's [GOAL] is not clear, make recommendations to the user:\n        - choose one of \"distribution\", \"overview\", \"summary\", \"forecast\" in \"mode\":\n            * if it is \"overview\" and the data is in wide format, reshape it into long format.\n            * if it is \"distribution\", select a few fields that would be interesting to visualize together.\n            * if it is \"summary\", calculate some aggregated statistics to show intresting facts of the data.\n            * if it is \"forecast\", concretize the x,y fields that will be used for forecasting and decide if it is about regression or forecasting.\n        - describe the recommendation reason in \"recommendation\"\n        - based on the recommendation, determine what is an ideal output data. Note, the output data must be in tidy format.\n        - then suggest recommendations of chart encoding that should be used to create the visualization.\n    - \"display_instruction\" should be a short verb phrase describing the users' goal, it should be even shorter than \"recap\". \n        - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n        - generate based on \"recap\" and the suggested visualization, but don't need to mention the visualization details.\n        - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n        - if the user instruction builds up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n        - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n        - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n            * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n            * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n    - \"chart_type\" must be one of \"point\", \"bar\", \"line\", \"area\", \"heatmap\", \"group_bar\"\n    - \"chart_encodings\" should specify which fields should be used to create the visualization\n        - decide which visual channels should be used to create the visualization appropriate for the chart type.\n            - point: x, y, color, size, facet\n            - histogram: x, color, facet\n            - bar: x, y, color, facet\n            - line: x, y, color, facet\n            - area: x, y, color, facet\n            - heatmap: x, y, color, facet\n            - group_bar: x, y, color, facet\n        - note that all fields used in \"chart_encodings\" should be included in \"output_fields\".\n            - all fields you need for visualizations should be transformed into the output fields!\n            - \"output_fields\" should include important intermediate fields that are not used in visualization but are used for data transformation.\n        - typically only 2-3 fields should be used to create the visualization (x, y, color/size), facet use be added if it's a faceted visualization (totally 4 fields used).\n    - Guidelines for choosing chart type and visualization fields:\n        - Consider chart types as follows:\n            - (point) Scatter Plots: x,y: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional), size: Quantitative (optional for creating bubble chart), \n                - best for: Relationships, correlations, distributions, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - scatter plots are good default way to visualize data when other chart types are not applicable.\n                - use color to visualize points from different categories.\n                - use size to visualize data points with an additional quantitative dimension of the data points.\n            - (histogram) Histograms: x: Quantitative/Categorical, color: Categorical (optional for creating grouped histogram), \n                - best for: Distribution of a quantitative field\n                - use x values directly if x values are categorical, and transform the data into bins if the field values are quantitative.\n                - when color is specified, the histogram will be grouped automatically (items with the same x values will be grouped).\n            - (bar) Bar Charts: x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical/Quantitative (for stacked bar chart / showing additional quantitative dimension), \n                - best for: Comparisons across categories\n                - use (bar) for simple bar chart or stacked bar chart (when it makes sense to add up Y values for each category with the same X value), \n                    - when color is specified, the bar will be stacked automatically (items with the same x values will be stacked).\n                    - note that when there are multiple rows in the data with same x values, the bar will be stacked automatically.\n                        - 1. consider to use an aggregated field for y values if the value is not suitable for stacking.\n                        - 2. consider to introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate bar.\n            - (group_bar) for grouped bar chart, x: Categorical (nominal/ordinal), y: Quantitative, color: Categorical\n                - when color is specifed, bars from different groups will be grouped automatically.\n                - only use facet if the cardinality of color field is small (less than 5).\n            - (line) Line Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating multiple lines), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data, forecasting, regression analysis\n                - note that when there are multiple rows in the data belong to the same group (same x and color values) but different y values, the line will not look correct.\n                - consider to use an aggregated field for y values, or introduce facets so that each group is visualized in a separate line.\n            - (area) Area Charts: x: Temporal (preferred) or ordinal, y: Quantitative, color: Categorical (optional for creating stacked areas), \n                - best for: Trends over time, continuous data\n            - (heatmap) Heatmaps: x,y: Categorical (you need to convert quantitative to nominal), color: Quantitative intensity, \n                - best for: Pattern discovery in matrix data\n        - facet channel is available for all chart types, it supports a categorical field with small cardinality to visualize the data in different facets.\n        - if you really need additional legend fields:\n            - you can use opacity for legend (support Quantitative and Categorical).\n    - visualization fields require tidy data. \n        - similar to VegaLite and ggplot2 so that each field is mapped to a visualization axis or legend. \n        - consider data transformations if you want to visualize multiple fields together:\n            - exapmle 1: suggest reshaping the data into long format in data transformation description (if these fields are all of the same type, e.g., they are all about sales, price, two columns about min/max-values, etc. don't mix different types of fields in reshaping) so we can visualize multiple fields as categories or in different facets.\n            - exapmle 2: calculate some derived fields from these fields(e.g., correlation, difference, profit etc.) in data transformation description to visualize them in one visualization.\n            - example 3: create a visualization only with a subset of the fields, you don't have to visualize all of them in one chart, you can later create a visualization with the rest of the fields. With the subset of charts, you can also consider reshaping or calculate some derived value.\n            - again, it does not make sense to have five fields like [item, A, B, C, D, E] in visualization fields, you should consider data transformation to reduce the number of fields.\n            - when reshaping data to long format, only fields of the same semantic type should be rehaped into the same column.\n    - guide on statistical analysis:\n        - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n            - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n            - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n                - put is_predicted field in 'opacity' channel to distinguish them.\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n            \n    2. Then, write a python function based on the inferred goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \n\"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined user intent in the json object.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable. \nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- you can use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n    \n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing inferred user intent and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (unemployment_across_industries)\n\n## fields\n\t*series -- type: object, values: Agriculture, Business services, Construction, ..., Other, Self-employed, Transportation and Utilities, Wholesale and Retail Trade\n\t*year -- type: int64, values: 2000, 2001, 2002, ..., 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\t*month -- type: int64, values: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11, 12\n\t*count -- type: int64, values: 2, 8, 9, ..., 2071, 2154, 2194, 2440\n\t*rate -- type: float64, values: 0.3, 1.3, 1.5, ..., 21.4, 22.7, 24.7, 27.1\n\t*date -- type: object, values: 2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z, ..., 2009-11-01T07:00:00.000Z, 2009-12-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n\n## sample\n       series  year  month  count  rate                      date\n0  Government  2000      1    430   2.1  2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z\n1  Government  2000      2    409   2.0  2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n2  Government  2000      3    311   1.5  2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z\n3  Government  2000      4    269   1.3  2000-04-01T08:00:00.000Z\n4  Government  2000      5    370   1.9  2000-05-01T07:00:00.000Z\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nCompare **unemployment trends** across all industries from 2000-2010"},{"role":"assistant","content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"User wants to compare unemployment trends across all industries from 2000-2010 to understand how different sectors were affected over time.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Compare **unemployment rates** across **industries** over time\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"A line chart with time on x-axis and unemployment rate on y-axis, with different colored lines for each industry series, will effectively show the trends and allow comparison of how unemployment evolved across different sectors during this period.\",\n    \"output_fields\": [\"date\", \"series\", \"rate\"],\n    \"chart_type\": \"line\",\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"date\",\n        \"y\": \"rate\",\n        \"color\": \"series\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform_data(df_unemployment):\n    # Convert date string to datetime and then to string format for visualization\n    df_unemployment['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_unemployment['date']).dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')\n    \n    # Select only the necessary columns for visualization\n    transformed_df = df_unemployment[['date', 'series', 'rate']].copy()\n    \n    return transformed_df\n```"},{"role":"user","content":"This is the result from the latest python code:\n\n         date      series  rate\n0  2000-01-01  Government   2.1\n1  2000-02-01  Government   2.0\n2  2000-03-01  Government   1.5\n3  2000-04-01  Government   1.3\n4  2000-05-01  Government   1.9\n5  2000-06-01  Government   3.1\n6  2000-07-01  Government   2.9\n7  2000-08-01  Government   3.1\n8  2000-09-01  Government   2.1\n9  2000-10-01  Government   2.0\n......\n\nUpdate the code above based on the following instruction:\n\nWhich industries showed the **sharpest increases** in unemployment during **2008-2009**?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"User wants to identify which industries experienced the sharpest increases in unemployment rates during the 2008-2009 financial crisis period by calculating the change in unemployment rate for each industry.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Identify industries with **sharpest unemployment rate increases** during **2008-2009**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"A bar chart showing the change in unemployment rate from 2008 to 2009 for each industry will clearly visualize which sectors were hit hardest during the financial crisis.

The reader doesn't understand code and does not want to learn exactly what the code is doing. They just want to learn what have been done from a logical level.\n    - The explanation should be a markdown string that is a list of bullet points (with new lines), highlight constants, data fields, and important verbs.\n2. Generate a list of explanations for new fields (fields not from the input data) that introduce metrics/concepts that are not obvious from the code.\n    - provide a declarative definition that explains the new field, use a mathematical notation if applicable.\n    - only include new fields explanation of new metrics that are involved in computation (e.g., ROI, commerical_success_score)\n    - *DO NOT* explain trivial new fields like \"Decade\" or \"Avg_Rating\", \"US_Sales\" that are self-explanatory.\n        - Avoid explaining fields that are simple aggregate of fields in the original data (min_score, avg_value, count, etc.)\n    - When a field involves mathematical computation, you can use LaTeX math notation in the explanation.

you information about what data would be needed, and your job is to create a python function based on the input data summary, transformation instruction and expected fields.\nThe users' instruction includes \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" that describe the visualization they want, and natural language instructions \"goal\" that describe what data is needed.\n\n**Important:**\n- NEVER make assumptions or judgments about a person's gender, biological sex, sexuality, religion, race, nationality, ethnicity, political stance, socioeconomic status, mental health, invisible disabilities, medical conditions, personality type, social impressions, emotional state, and cognitive state.\n- NEVER create formulas that could be used to discriminate based on age. Ageism of any form (explicit and implicit) is strictly prohibited.\n- If above issue occurs, generate columns with np.nan.\n\nConcretely, you should first refine users' goal and then create a python function in the output section based off the [CONTEXT] and [GOAL]:\n\n    1. First, refine users' [GOAL]. The main objective in this step is to check if \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\" provided by the user are sufficient to achieve their \"goal\". Concretely:\n        - based on the user's \"goal\" and \"chart_type\" and \"chart_encodings\", elaborate the goal into a \"detailed_instruction\".\n        - \"display_instruction\" is a short verb phrase describing the users' goal. \n            - it would be a short verbal description of user intent as a verb phrase (<12 words).\n            - generate it based on detailed_instruction and the suggested chart_type and chart_encodings, but don't need to mention the chart details.\n            - should capture key computation ideas: by reading the display, the user can understand the purpose and what's derived from the data.\n            - if the user specification follows up the previous instruction, the 'display_instruction' should only describe how it builds up the previous instruction without repeating information from previous steps.\n            - the phrase can be presented in different styles, e.g., question (what's xxx), instruction (show xxx), description, etc.\n            - if you mention column names from the input or the output data, highlight the text in **bold**.\n                * the column can either be a column in the input data, or a new column that will be computed in the output data.\n                * the mention don't have to be exact match, it can be semantically matching, e.g., if you mentioned \"average score\" in the text while the column to be computed is \"Avg_Score\", you should still highlight \"**average score**\" in the text.\n        - determine \"output_fields\", the desired fields that the output data should have to achieve the user's goal, it's a good idea to include intermediate fields here.\n        - then decide \"chart_encodings\", which maps visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized, \n            - the \"chart_encodings\" should be created to support the user's \"chart_type\".\n            - first, determine whether the user has provided sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\" that are needed to achieve their goal:\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" are sufficient, simply copy it.\n                - if the user didn't provide sufficient fields in \"chart_encodings\", add missing fields in \"chart_encodings\" (ordered them based on whether the field will be used in x,y axes or legends);\n                    - \"chart_encodings\" should only include fields that will be visualized (do not include other intermediate fields from \"output_fields\")  \n                    - when adding new fields to \"chart_encodings\", be efficient and add only a minimal number of fields that are needed to achive the user's goal. \n                    - generally, the total number of fields in \"chart_encodings\" should be no more than 3 for x,y,legend.\n                - if the user's \"chart_encodings\" is sufficient but can be optimized, you can reorder encodings to visualize the data more effectively.\n            - sometimes, user may provide instruction to update visualizations fields they provided. You should leverage the user's goal to resolve the conflict and decide the final \"chart_encodings\"\n                - e.g., they may mention \"use B metric instead\" while A metric is in provided fields, in this case, you should update \"chart_encodings\" to update A metric with B metric.\n        - guide on statistical analysis:\n            - when the user asks for forecasting or regression analysis, you should consider the following:\n                - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs and predicted x, y pairs are included in the X, Y columns, they are differentiated with a third column \"is_predicted\" that is a boolean field.\n                - i.e., if the user ask for forecasting based on two columns T and Y, the output should be three columns: T, Y, is_predicted, where\n                    - T, Y columns contain BOTH original values from the data and predicted values from the data.\n                    - is_predicted is a boolean field to indicate whether the x, y pairs are original values from the data or predicted / regression values from the data.\n                - the recommended chart should be line chart (time series) or scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n                - if the user asks for forecasting, it's good to include predicted x, y pairs for both x in the original data and future x values (i.e., combine regression and forecasting results)\n                    - in this case, is_predicted should be of three values 'original', 'regression', 'forecasting'\n        - when the user asks for clustering:\n            - the output should be a long format table where actual x, y pairs with a third column \"cluster_id\" that indicates the cluster id of the data point.\n            - the recommended chart should be scatter plot (quantitative x, y)\n    \n    Prepare the result in the following json format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"detailed_instruction\": \"...\" // string, elaborate user instruction with details if the user\n    \"display_instruction\": \"...\" // string, the short verb phrase describing the users' goal.\n    \"output_fields\": [...] // string[], describe the desired output fields that the output data should have based on the user's goal, it's a good idea to preserve intermediate fields here (i.e., the goal of transformed data)\n    \"chart_encodings\": {\n        \"x\": \"\",\n        \"y\": \"\",\n        \"color\": \"\",\n        \"size\": \"\",\n        \"opacity\": \"\",\n        \"facet\": \"\",\n        ... // other visualization channels user used\n    } // object: map visualization channels (x, y, color, size, opacity, facet, etc.) to a subset of \"output_fields\" that will be visualized.\n    \"reason\": \"...\" // string, explain why this refinement is made\n}\n```\n\n    2. Then, write a python function based on the refined goal, the function input is a dataframe \"df\" (or multiple dataframes based on tables presented in the [CONTEXT] section) and the output is the transformed dataframe \"transformed_df\". \"transformed_df\" should contain all \"output_fields\" from the refined goal.\nThe python function must follow the template provided in [TEMPLATE], do not import any other libraries or modify function name. The function should be as simple as possible and easily readable.\nIf there is no data transformation needed based on \"output_fields\", the transformation function can simply \"return df\".\n\n[TEMPLATE]\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import ... # import necessary libraries from sklearn if needed\n\ndef transform_data(df1, df2, ...): \n    # complete the template here\n    return transformed_df\n```\n\nnote: \n- if the user provided one table, then it should be `def transform_data(df1)`, if the user provided multiple tables, then it should be `def transform_data(df1, df2, ...)` and you should consider the join between tables to derive the output.\n- **VERY IMPORTANT** the number of arguments in the function must match the number of tables provided, and the order of arguments must match the order of tables provided.\n- try to use intuitive table names to refer to the input dataframes, for example, if the user provided two tables city and weather, you can use `transform_data(df_city, df_weather)` to refer to the two dataframes, as long as the number and order of the arguments match the number and order of the tables provided.\n- datetime objects handling:\n    - if the output field is year, convert it to number, if it is year-month / year-month-day, convert it to string object (e.g., \"2020-01\" / \"2020-01-01\").\n    - if the output is time only: convert hour to number if it's just the hour (e.g., 10), but convert hour:min or h:m:s to string object (e.g., \"10:30\", \"10:30:45\")\n    - never return datetime object directly, convert it to either number (if it only contains year) or string so it's readable.\n\n    3. The output must only contain a json object representing the refined goal and a python code block representing the transformation code, do not add any extra text explanation.\n","role":"system"},{"content":"[CONTEXT]\n\nHere are our datasets, here are their summaries and samples:\n\n# table1 (unemployment_across_industries)\n\n## fields\n\t*series -- type: object, values: Agriculture, Business services, Construction, ..., Other, Self-employed, Transportation and Utilities, Wholesale and Retail Trade\n\t*year -- type: int64, values: 2000, 2001, 2002, ..., 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\t*month -- type: int64, values: 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11, 12\n\t*count -- type: int64, values: 2, 8, 9, ..., 2071, 2154, 2194, 2440\n\t*rate -- type: float64, values: 0.3, 1.3, 1.5, ..., 21.4, 22.7, 24.7, 27.1\n\t*date -- type: object, values: 2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z, ..., 2009-11-01T07:00:00.000Z, 2009-12-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-01-01T08:00:00.000Z, 2010-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n\n## sample\n       series  year  month  count  rate                      date\n0  Government  2000      1    430   2.1  2000-01-01T08:00:00.000Z\n1  Government  2000      2    409   2.0  2000-02-01T08:00:00.000Z\n2  Government  2000      3    311   1.5  2000-03-01T08:00:00.000Z\n3  Government  2000      4    269   1.3  2000-04-01T08:00:00.000Z\n4  Government  2000      5    370   1.9  2000-05-01T07:00:00.000Z\n......\n\n\n\n\n[GOAL]\n\nHow does **seasonal variation** in unemployment differ across **industries**?","role":"user"},{"content":"```json\n{\n    \"mode\": \"infer\",\n    \"recap\": \"Analyze how seasonal variation in unemployment differs across industries by examining the cyclical patterns in unemployment rates throughout the year for different industry sectors.\",\n    \"display_instruction\": \"Compare seasonal unemployment patterns across **industries**\",\n    \"recommendation\": \"To visualize seasonal variation across industries, we should calculate average unemployment rates by month for each industry series.

Analysis of 14 industry sectors demonstrates that certain industries face predictable cyclical challenges while others maintain relative stability throughout the year.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760745546664)]\n\n**Cross-industry seasonal dynamics** show distinct unemployment patterns throughout the calendar year. Key findings include:\n\n- **Agriculture** experiences the most dramatic seasonal swings, with unemployment rates peaking above 13% in winter months (January-March) and dropping to approximately 7% during summer harvest seasons\n- **Construction** exhibits similar seasonality, with rates near 13% in January declining to 7-8% during peak building months (May-September)\n- **Government and Finance** sectors demonstrate remarkable stability, maintaining unemployment rates between 2-4% year-round, suggesting these sectors are largely insulated from seasonal fluctuations\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760745839180)]\n\n**Year-over-year trends for the most seasonal industries** reveal how economic conditions compound seasonal effects. The 2008-2009 recession created unprecedented spikes:\n\n- Construction unemployment surged from typical winter peaks of 10-13% to over 25% by early 2010\n- Agriculture showed dramatic year-to-year variation, with 2009-2010 winter unemployment reaching 19-21%, nearly double the levels seen in 2000\n- Mining and Extraction maintained lower overall rates (2-7%) but still exhibited seasonal patterns, with late-year increases across most periods\n\n**In summary**, industries reliant on weather-dependent operations face significant seasonal unemployment challenges, which are dramatically amplified during economic recessions. While sectors like Government and Finance maintain stable employment year-round, Agriculture and Construction workers experience predictable winter unemployment that can more than double during economic downturns. These patterns suggest the need for targeted workforce development and social safety net programs that account for both seasonal and cyclical employment disruptions. Further investigation should examine whether these patterns have evolved post-2010 and assess the effectiveness of countercyclical policies in stabilizing employment in vulnerable sectors.","style":"executive summary","selectedChartIds":["chart-1760745546664","chart-1760745839180"],"createdAt":1760831421331},{"id":"report-1760831364867-9457","content":"# Unemployment Surge Across Industries: The 2008-2009 Economic Crisis Impact\n\nThe decade from 2000 to 2010 witnessed significant volatility in unemployment rates across major industry sectors, with a dramatic escalation during the 2008-2009 financial crisis that fundamentally reshaped the American labor market.\n\n[IMAGE(chart-1760745539559)]\n\nThe longitudinal analysis reveals that while most industries maintained relatively stable unemployment rates between 2000 and 2007—typically fluctuating between 2% and 8%—the landscape changed dramatically beginning in late 2008. **Construction** emerged as the most severely impacted sector, with unemployment rates soaring to approximately **27% by early 2010**.
