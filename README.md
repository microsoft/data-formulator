## News 🔥🔥🔥

[05-11-2026] **Data Formulator 0.7 (alpha 2)** — A new chapter for AI-powered data exploration
-  🔌 **Data connectors** — first-class persistent connection to Superset, Kusto, Cosmos DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, S3, Azure Blob, BigQuery, and more, with SSO, lazy catalog loading, search, and smart filters.
-  💬 **Conversational agent with thread memory** — a unified `DataAgent` that weaves explanation, exploration, visualization, and recommendation into one fluid conversation, carrying context across turns so the agent stays in sync with your train of thought.
-  🗂️ **Persistent session & workspace management** — identity-isolated workspaces with local and Azure Blob backends; sessions persist across restarts with timestamps and sort.
-  📊 **Expressive visualization** — 30+ chart types via a new semantic chart engine (area, streamgraph, candlestick, pie, radar, maps, …), plus a chart style-refinement agent that turns rough charts into presentation-ready visuals: restyle in one click, refine typography, color, layout, and annotations through natural language.
-  📚 **Knowledge distillation (experimental)** — agents distill reusable skills and experiences from your sessions into a shared knowledge library that informs future sessions.

> Install the pre-release with `pip install --pre data-formulator` or pin `==0.7.0a2`.

> [!TIP]
> **Are you a developer?** Join us to shape the future of AI-powered data exploration!
> We're looking for help with new agents, data connectors, chart templates, and more.
> Check out the [Developers' Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) and our [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/issues).

## Overview

**Data Formulator** is a Microsoft Research prototype for data exploration with visualizations powered by AI agents.

Data Formulator enables analysts to explore data with visualizations. Started with data in any format (screenshot, text, csv, or database), you can work with AI agents with a novel blended interface that combines *user interface interactions (UI)* and *natural language (NL) inputs* to communicate their intents, control branching exploration directions, and create reports to share their insights. 

## Get Started

Play with Data Formulator with one of the following options. 

- **Option 1: Install via uv (recommended)**
  
  [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an extremely fast Python package manager. If you have uv installed, you can run Data Formulator directly without any setup:
  
  ```bash
  uvx data_formulator
  ```

  Run `uvx data_formulator --help` to see all available options, such as custom port, sandboxing mode, and data storage location.

- **Option 2: Install via pip**
  
  Use pip for installation (recommend: install it in a virtual environment).
  
  ```bash
  pip install data_formulator # install
  python -m data_formulator # run
  ```

  Data Formulator will be automatically opened in the browser at [http://localhost:5567](http://localhost:5567).

- **Option 3: Run with Docker**

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  ```

  Open [http://localhost:5567](http://localhost:5567) in your browser. To stop, press `Ctrl+C` or run `docker compose down`.

- **Option 4: Codespaces**

  You can run Data Formulator in Codespaces; we have everything pre-configured. For more details, see [CODESPACES.md](CODESPACES.md).
  
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/data-formulator?quickstart=1)


- **Option 5: Working as developer**
  
  You can build Data Formulator locally and develop your own version. Check out details in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).


## Using Data Formulator

Besides uploading csv, tsv or xlsx files that contain structured data, you can ask Data Formulator to extract data from screenshots, text blocks or websites, or load data from databases use connectors. Then you are ready to explore. Ask visualizaiton questions, edit charts, or delegate some exploration tasks to agents. Then, create reports to share your insights.
