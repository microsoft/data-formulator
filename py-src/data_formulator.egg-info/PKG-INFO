## News üî•üî•üî•

- [02-12-2025] More models supported now!
  - Now supports OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, and Anthropic models (and more powered by [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm));
  - Models with strong code generation and instruction following capabilities are recommended (gpt-4o, claude-3-5-sonnet etc.);
  - You can store API keys in `api-keys.env` to avoid typing them every time (see template `api-keys.env.template`).
  - Let us know which models you have good/bad experiences with, and what models you would like to see supported! [[comment here]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/issues/49)

- [11-07-2024] Minor fun update: data visualization challenges!
  - We added a few visualization challenges with the sample datasets. Can you complete them all? [[try them out!]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/issues/53#issue-2641841252)
  - Comment in the issue when you did, or share your results/questions with others! [[comment here]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/issues/53)

- [10-11-2024] Data Formulator python package released! 
  - You can now install Data Formulator using Python and run it locally, easily. [[check it out]](#get-started).
  - Our Codespaces configuration is also updated for fast start up ‚ö°Ô∏è. [[try it now!]](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/data-formulator?quickstart=1)
  - New experimental feature: load an image or a messy text, and ask AI to parse and clean it for you(!). [[demo]](https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/pull/31#issuecomment-2403652717)
  
- [10-01-2024] Initial release of Data Formulator, check out our [[blog]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/data-formulator-exploring-how-ai-can-help-analysts-create-rich-data-visualizations/) and [[video]](https://youtu.be/3ndlwt0Wi3c)!



## Overview

**Data Formulator** is an application from Microsoft Research that uses large language models to transform data, expediting the practice of data visualization.

Data Formulator is an AI-powered tool for analysts to iteratively create rich visualizations. Unlike most chat-based AI tools where users need to describe everything in natural language, Data Formulator combines *user interface interactions (UI)* and *natural language (NL) inputs* for easier interaction. This blended approach makes it easier for users to describe their chart designs while delegating data transformation to AI. 

## Get Started

Play with Data Formulator with one of the following options:

- **Option 1: Install via Python PIP**
  
  Use Python PIP for an easy setup experience, running locally (recommend: install it in a virtual environment).
  
  ```bash
  # install data_formulator
  pip install data_formulator

  # start data_formulator
  data_formulator 
  
  # alternatively, you can run data formulator with this command
  python -m data_formulator
  ```

  Data Formulator will be automatically opened in the browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

  *Update: you can specify the port number (e.g., 8080) by `python -m data_formulator --port 8080` if the default port is occupied.*

- **Option 2: Codespaces (5 minutes)**
  
  You can also run Data Formulator in Codespaces; we have everything pre-configured. For more details, see [CODESPACES.md](CODESPACES.md).
  
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/data-formulator?quickstart=1)

- **Option 3: Working in the developer mode**
  
  You can build Data Formulator locally if you prefer full control over your development environment and the ability to customize the setup to your specific needs. For detailed instructions, refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).


## Using Data Formulator

Once you've completed the setup using either option, follow these steps to start using Data Formulator:

### The basics of data visualization
* Provide OpenAI keys and select a model (GPT-4o suggested) and choose a dataset.
* Choose a chart type, and then drag-and-drop data fields to chart properties (x, y, color, ...) to specify visual encodings.

### Create visualization beyond the initial dataset (powered by ü§ñ)
* You can type names of **fields that do not exist in current data** in the encoding shelf:
    - this tells Data Formulator that you want to create visualizations that require computation or transformation from existing data,
    - you can optionally provide a natural language prompt to explain and clarify your intent (not necessary when field names are self-explanatory).
* Click the **Formulate** button.
    - Data Formulator will transform data and instantiate the visualization based on the encoding and prompt.
* Inspect the data, chart and code.
* To create a new chart based on existing ones, follow up in natural language:
    - provide a follow up prompt (e.g., *``show only top 5!''*),
    - you may also update visual encodings for the new chart.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93b3e84-8ca8-49ae-80ea-f91ceef34acb

Repeat this process as needed to explore and understand your data. Your explorations are trackable in the **Data Threads** panel. 

## Developers' Guide

Follow the [developers' instructions](DEVELOPMENT.md) to build your new data analysis tools on top of Data Formulator.
